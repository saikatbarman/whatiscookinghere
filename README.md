Hi everyone,

I am trying to build a repository for myself and extend it for others to use as a public reporitory.

I am working with JAVA but the recent trend of technology change has intrigued my mind with different technologies. I have been working with Hadoop and other Big Data technologies. I am loving to explore the Analytics domain and right now working on the following technologies:

1. Big Data and related techs
2. Hadoop
3. Android
4. Machine Learning
5. Master Data Management
6. Web Services
7. Amazon Web Services

This is my first attempt to use GitHub. Looking forward for a pleasant stay.
